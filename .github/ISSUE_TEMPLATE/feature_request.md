**At a high level -- can you summarize your request?**

(E.g.) I would like to be able to combine btf information with the map entries
to have better formatted data

**Is the current alternative solution?**

(E.g.) Dump btf information using bpftool yourself

**Is the feature platform, distro, or architecture dependent?**

If so please specify which ones

**Anything else?**

Please list anything else that might help us implement the feature you're requesting. This could include marked-up screenshots, mockups, etc.
